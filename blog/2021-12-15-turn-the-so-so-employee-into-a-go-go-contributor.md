"The only thing worse than training your employees and having them leave is not training them and having them stay."

Henry Ford, American automobile manufacturer and business leader

:::

### "Jobs have never been so secure. Bosses have stopped firing people."

That's the headline of a CNN Business article this week. Firings and layoffs have nearly stopped as employers do everything they can to keep their all important staff. There are about three job openings for every two job seekers according to latest statistics. With there being more jobs open than job seekers, employers are retaining employees that otherwise they may have let go in the past.

Letting a so-so employee go now means the employer could end up hiring someone who a) costs more, b) takes a long time to find and c) may not even as good as who they let go! To add to the pain, while searching for this new hire, the business suffers with a lack of enough staff, the lower morale of the remaining staff that has to take on additional duties, remaining staff can become disgruntled, and so on. The business can take a real downward spiral. To avoid that, the business keeps the so-so employee; warm bodies are better than no bodies.

A so-so employee usually means that they are on a "PIP", the dreaded performance improvement plan. Typically that means the employee is being pushed toward the door unless they make a drastic turnaround. Not so now. Given today's crazy job market, with the desire to keep staff and keep that staff productively working, the PIP is more likely an employee training program with hopes of true improvement.
