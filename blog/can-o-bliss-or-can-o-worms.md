Talk to developer journey from when i was 12, doing html, css, js with front page, dreamweaver; to needing more dynamic sites and turning to Flash and eventually Flex as a programming language for flash; to .NET MVC and the myriad of component libraries and the way server to client js used to work... server side rendered, boilerplate around javascript; to where we are now with entire frontend frameworks like angular, react and more...  The boilerplate moved to client, but still boiler plate around javascript..

As I look back through that journey, I think there is one common theme...  I spent a lot of time trying to avoid writing native javascript.   I'm here to say that rat-race is over.

"The purpose of declaration files is to define a semantic subset of JavaScript libraries and that makes sense."
-- The purpose of SemanticJS is to provide a framework to define the "semantic subset" unique to an enterprise, with an ecosystem of pre-built building blocks for pulling together enterprise semantic architectures.
