Contrary to how they sound, micro frontends support big teams.  

At Fathym, we’ve been working hard to bring you LowCodeUnit – our micro frontend framework – and now we’re moving out of the production phase and into user adoption with a freemium model.  

Simply, [LowCodeUnit](https://www.lowcodeunit.com/blog/why-lowcodeunit-rocks-and-saves-you-time) is our solution to modern web hosting.  

“We’re a modern-day webhost,” our Todd German explained. “If you made a website 20 years ago, you had to FTP your files onto somebody’s server. It is a mess!  

“Today, if you have a site, we can have you up and hosted, with no cost, instantly,” German continued. “It’s a world of difference from the big competitors. That includes the synchronization of GitHub.” 

Using GitHub as our repository, LowCodeUnit is a virtual developer, working hard behind the scenes for you. It can not only handle the build scripts of a Dev Ops engineer but also allows QA people to create their own testing environments.  

That’s where our micro frontends take center stage. 

## Micro frontends definition

Micro frontends as a concept are somewhat simple; they break down the monolithic frontend codebases into smaller, more manageable applications which can be created and delivered by individual teams.  

Within LowCodeUnit, they allow a developer to create a main branch, and then many branches off that. Think of a tree’s trunk, the main branches growing away from it, and then the smaller twigs on the ends of the branches.

It means simple, straightforward routes to your different pages or kinds of utilities, like e-commerce, blogs or technical documentation software like Docusaurus. 

For a small group, it helps because you can have one branch as your live page, and another as a test page to test as you go. Meaning, you can handle the job of multiple people thanks to the heavy lifting being performed on the back end by LowCodeUnit. And then others can jump in and help thanks to the organization associated with micro frontends.  

“It allows me to have this project, which is our dev test site, and also allows me to create another project here, which would be our production site,” engineer Todd German showed. “And, since they’re both tied to different branches, more people can now contribute.” 

Of course, that also benefits a bigger company even more. When there are multiple chefs in the kitchen, it can be difficult to get the recipe just right. But micro frontends allow “sous chefs” (engineers) to create in their own kitchen and then the “head chef” (QA) can approve the meal before it goes out the door.  

“With LowCodeUnit we’re able to have this feature branch that a developer is working on,” engineer Trevor Richardson said. “They made their changes, they fixed their bug, they added some sort of UI element. Then, they pushed their code and when they did the source control in LowCodeUnit automatically builds that version and saves it. And then from there the developer can go to their QA person and tell them they’re ready to test.  

“Now the QA person goes to their own instance of LowCodeUnit and creates their own QA project or their own QA apps and just point to that feature branch that developer is using. So, it’s completely separated. The QA is testing the exact feature or bug fix they need to be testing without any interference. 

“LowCodeUnit is handling all of the automated building, the merging of branches. Everything is happening behind the scenes. You don’t even need to know GitHub, really,” Richardson finished. 

That’s right, with LowCodeUnit, a business can save labor thanks to automation, and it’s also more efficient because multiple people can be working towards the same goal (frontend integration) at the same time.  

For a bigger business, think of it in terms of having multiple teams within the larger group.  

You’re working to build a website and have three teams devoted to: Content, layout, and e-commerce. All three teams work independently on their individual missions, checking off boxes and meeting expectations. Then, everything is integrated on the main branch, delivering the final product to the customer or user.

In an ever-changing technological world, micro-frontends are the way of the future. Out with the monolithic frontends of the past. It’s time for a simpler, smarter, more efficient way of building websites.
