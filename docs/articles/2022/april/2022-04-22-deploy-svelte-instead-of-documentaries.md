I watched -- ok, let me rephrase -- I tried to watch the Abercrombie & Fitch documentary last night. But I just couldn’t finish it. It brought back all those uncomfortable memories from the mall.  

Yup, I just said “mall.” For those younger than 20, a mall was one big box building with walls and different stores resided within those walls. People walked around and shopped inside the big box. It was an effortless way to shop – stores were clustered together, and you could not get rained or snowed on when you stepped out of a store. It was an exceptionally straightforward way to get you to go in more stores than you normally would if walking down a typical main street shopping area.  

Back to those memories and the early 2000s. 

My impression of A&F was not particularly great. The store was foreboding – it had those weird front doors with dark shutters and salespeople stood in front of store and spritzed you. Spritzed! I didn’t want to be spritzed. Spritzed meant sneezing.  

So, I veered away from that store. Mostly.  

I went in a few times. It was dark inside. And I found it odd that a clothing store mostly promoted itself with half-naked models. Shouldn’t they have the brand’s clothes on? Didn’t that make sense? They were a clothing store after all.  

But branding and marketing do not always make sense.

What does make sense is that the A&F I remember is no longer. The business and their values had to change. Watch the documentary [White Hot, The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch](https://www.netflix.com/title/81323741) – the change had to happen for a variety of reasons. And along with that, their digital presence had to change. 

## Brand and digital presence flexibility 

Let’s bring this all back to you. (I don’t really want to talk about A&F, but it is interesting.)  

Your digital presence must evolve as you, your organization, your products, your brand, your marketing evolve. That will and should happen.  

Changing your digital presence is necessary so that you can communicate with your audience as to who and what you are right now.  

Being able to change your digital presence should not be difficult. Standing up your website and being able to change as you see fit are a necessity for your livelihood and longevity of your products. Those changes must be easy.
