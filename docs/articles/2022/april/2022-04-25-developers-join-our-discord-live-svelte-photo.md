Just as we’re leveling up as a company, one of our goals is to help developers and businesses grow, too.  

Let’s all grow together!  

In the spirit of collaboration and inclusivity – two of our core values – we invite any and all developers to join us at our Discord Live. 

## Discord Live 

Come join us virtually on [Wednesday, April 27 at 2 p.m. MDT on our Discord Channel!](https://discord.com/invite/qh3eCBgpC5) 

Our Director of Engineering Jeremy Tomlinson will be teaching developers a lot during the meeting.  

First and foremost, he’ll be using the Fathym platform. So, if you’ve ever wondered what it looks like to work with micro frontends, you’ll get your chance to see it in action here. It’s also free to join, so we’re hoping you will jump into all that Fathym offers.  

Secondly, you’ll get to experience the [Social UI](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/march/2022-03-02-introducing-fathyms-social-ui) which makes developing as a team much easier. It’s intuitively built so users can jump in and get to work without having to figure out how it works. No more jumping back and forth between GitHub to see if changes have been made, it’s all available there.  

Finally, Jeremy will walk you through how to use Svelte to put up a photo gallery quickly. Of course, displaying photos – and other visual content, like graphics – is crucial for so many websites and businesses, so we’re going to start our learning there.  

## Svelte benefits 

Svelte is a wonderful JavaScript framework, too. Even though there’s a very shallow learning curve, it still builds beautiful websites and apps. It also requires less code to write. And websites built in Svelte are extremely well-performing (See: Fast).  

[Feltcoop on GitHub](https://github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte#feels-good) even says, “Making UIs with Svelte is a pleasure. Svelte’s aesthetics feel like a warm cozy blanket on the stormy web. This impacts everything — features, documentation, syntax, semantics, performance, framework internals, npm install size, the welcoming and helpful community attitude, and its collegial open development and RFCs — it all oozes good taste.” 

And according to Stackoverflow’s 2021 survey, [Svelte is the most well-liked JavaScript framework on the market today.](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/april/2022-04-13-micro-frontend-popularity)  

We’re looking forward to you joining us on Wednesday, and we’re looking forward to answering any questions you may have.
