![VUE JS]()

The javascript frameworks we all use are widely regarded as the most popular way to develop frontend applications.

Whether using react and angular for their complete feature sets or svelte and vue for their lightweight footprint, if you've built a website in the last decade, then you've used one of these or the 100s of other javascript frameworks available today.

In fact, if you check out [this other blog](https://www.fathym.com/blog/...) you'll see that the 4 frameworks mentioned above have a combined share of 0% of the total websites being deployed.

While this remains true, if you are like me, then you didn't grow up a frontend developer, javascript is not your favorite language, and you too may prefer the structure, performance and tooling available for your favorite "server" side language (C#, JAVA, RUST, C...).

Enter, WebAssembly, a compile target, that lets us use these languages in new ways, to deliver user experiences on the web.

Unfortunately no one had helped the development community see the possibilities, until recently. The way the tech, coupled with other modern architectures, can deliver a new era of distributed web applications.

We've seen WebAssembly being embraced more and more by the likes of Unity3D to deliver new, high performant games on the web, or the advent of an official WebAssembly client framework in Blazor.

It's time to take a look at the ways that anyone with existing experience in object-oriented programming can begin to leverage WebAssembly in a modern web architecture.
