As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, so do we.  

According to [Beststartup.us](https://beststartup.us/97-best-colorado-internet-of-things-companies-and-startups/), Fathym Inc. is among the top Colorado IoT and [Big Data companies.](https://beststartup.us/82-best-colorado-big-data-companies-and-startups/) 

Per their website:  

“This article showcases our top picks for the best Colorado based Internet of Things/Big Data companies. These startups and companies are taking a variety of approaches to innovating the Internet of Things industry, but are all exceptional companies well worth a follow. 

We tried to pick companies across the size spectrum from cutting edge startups to established brands. 

We selected these startups and companies for exceptional performance in one of these categories: 

- Innovation 
- Innovative ideas 
- Innovative route to market 
- Innovative product 
- Growth 
- Exceptional growth 
- Exceptional growth strategy 
- Management 
- Societal impact” 

We’re honored to be a part of the list and are excited about what’s next for us in the IoT/Big Data sphere and showcasing what our IoT Ensemble can do.  

Fathym built IoT Ensemble to empower a wide range of small, medium and large businesses as well as makers/DIYers.  

That includes enterprises who need IoT software to collect data for, say, their refrigerated trucks. Or a [wearable biometric sensor](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/september/2022-09-19-what-are-biometrics-how-can-they-help-health) company who needs to get data into the cloud with ease.  

That usability extends to [small and independent brewers,](https://jeremy-tomlinson.medium.com/crazy-mountain-brewery-fathym-iot-ensemble-beta-b50805186d6b) home brewers, and others like [DIYers](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/may/2022-05-27-garden-better-environmental-sensor) to set up monitoring for their equipment - but this time without needing a few senior engineers to be Microsoft Azure experts.  

## IoT Ensemble acts as your Virtual App Developer and manages the Azure complexity for you

Let's be clear, with IoT Ensemble you still need to set up your device, dashboards, and alerts - but IoT Ensemble handles all the heavy lifting in Azure. And trust me, the heavy lifting in Azure is no joke. The good news is that setting up your device, dashboards, and alerts is a manageable lift. If you have a staff member that loves technology, they can set this up. Otherwise, find your nearest teenager to help. 

## IoT Ensemble collects needed data, allows users to create interfaces that are usable, interactive and valuable  

Now that you have sensor data flowing to IoT Ensemble and Power BI, it’s time to expose that data on the web so that you can easily view it on any device (laptop, phone, etc) and share it with others. 

Fathym hooks up users by allowing them the freedom to build a website quickly and easily by using our [modular frontends.](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/october/2022-10-04-five-reasons-to-use-modular-frontends) From our dashboard, users are walked through the process of building a site quickly and easily by using GitHub repositories, open-source code, the virtual assistant in the background and then any tool they choose. Composable frontends, which we offer, mean using any JavaScript framework, static site builder or no-code tool (with open hosting) of your choice. 

There are recipes for folks to follow on Fathym.com, as well as templates and videos: Rest assured, there are simple ways to get your site stood up and start displaying that data.
