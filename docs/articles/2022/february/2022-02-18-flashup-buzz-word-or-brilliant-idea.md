Consider this the beginning of the end of the term “startup” and the beginning of a new term, “flashup.” 

Startups take planning, investors, bogus promises and best guesses. And what’s the most costly thing startups take? Time.  

Instead, flashups are businesses which can get started in a hurry. They start in a flash, like a wildfire, and hopefully spread like one, too.  

“We don't just want a faster web, we want a web that provides faster results,” Fathym CTO Mike Gearhardt explained. “Performance of an application in terms of load times is one thing, building an application that performs for a business is another.” 

“Our competitors talk about building apps. We’ve always been about building businesses and opportunities,” Gearhardt continued.

Fathym takes pride in being able to utilize the best open-source applications out there, and then turn them into a working website, hosted by us and run by our virtual developers in the background. All in mere minutes. Really! 

By using the powerful computing behind-the-scenes at Fathym, we’ve been able to create “flashups” incredibly quickly. What sets us apart from the competitors is we’re a [micro frontends platform, they aren’t](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/february/2022-02-14-fathym-vs-netlify-and-vercel-micro-frontends).

An example of a flashup follows: [Our frontend engineer George Hatch was able to create his partner a website](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2021/december/2021-12-30-How-to-host-an-ecommerce-site-with-fathym) – Redwoodcystals.com – by utilizing Forestry CMS as his content manager, 11ty as a static site generator and then Snipcart as the e-commerce solution.

“Fathym helped me be able to get that out there and understand, ‘OK, so I push to GitHub and then I connect that GitHub build to Fathym and that’s all I need to do. Then Fathym’s virtual developers handle everything else behind the scenes,” Hatch explained. 

## “Flashups” aren’t just a passing fad, either. 

And as it turns out, growth is crucial in today’s technology market. 

From [Tech Crunch’s piece that came out today](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/18/for-startups-the-message-is-clear-grow-fast-or-die/): 

> “Last summer, The Exchange jokingly said that cloud companies — software firms that deliver their products via the internet — were in a grow-or-die situation, comparing difficult results from Dropbox and Box with a few high-growth startups. From where we sit today, June 2021 might as well be a decade ago in terms of market conditions, but I raise the reminder to underscore that growth has always mattered; we’re not treading new water here.

“What has changed, it appears, is that the bar for what counts as a good performance in earnings is weighted nearly entirely on forward growth.” 

Being able to put together a website build in a jiffy allows businesses to go from would-be startup, to flashup. Because, life changes fast, and your ability to adapt needs to keep up.
