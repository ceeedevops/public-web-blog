Want to turn your Figma designs into enterprise-ready apps with the touch of a button? Fathym does that. 

Figma, the world-class design tool, [announced today](https://www.figma.com/blog/a-new-collaboration-with-adobe/) they have entered a partnership with Adobe.  

[According to Barron’s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/adobe-buying-software-design-company-figma-51663244505), Adobe is paying $20 billion in cash and stocks to acquire Figma, with the deal expected to close in 2023.  

Founded in 2012, Figma has seen a sharp rise recently in the world of web and software design. It’s beloved by designers, marketers, content creators and the like for the way it allows teams to collaborate and due to its powerful, ease-of-use.  

Figma is a collaborative design tool which allows a wide variety of professionals to work together on a project. As [explained on their website,](https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-enterprise-explained/) 

“We genuinely believe that hearing everyone’s input and representing their opinions results in more thoughtfully-designed products, so we encourage collaboration at all stages of the development process.” 

In that way, Figma has been used by big-time companies like Square, Dropbox, Stripe and Twitter, among others, to creatively and effectively solve problems.  
 

## Web applications 

When it comes to the design of web applications and user interfaces, Figma is considered the best according to [Gartner’s Peer Insights.](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/prototyping-software/vendor/figma/product/figma). The ratings of enterprise users place Figma (4.6 out of 5.0) in the No. 1 spot ahead of Adobe XD (4.4), Miro (4.3) and Sketch (4.1).  

After designing a dynamic web app, the next step is to bring it to fruition.  

## Fathym and Figma work together to make app creation easy 

After designing your user interface within Figma, teams can utilize a [plugin like Builder.io](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/747985167520967365) to turn the beautiful and functional look **into** code.  

Then, thanks to [composable frontends,](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/september/2022-09-01-explaining-composable-frontend-architecture-as-simply-as-possible) the Fathym Platform offers the solution of where to turn that code into a live web app.  

Whether you choose to convert the design into React, Vue or another framework, you can then export the code and get your app up and hosted in a matter of minutes. [Read more on how to do that here.](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/may/2022-05-10-figma-firejet-fathym-fantastic) 
 

## Enterprise scale out of the box 

By using Fathym to launch your Figma application you are enterprise scale and ready out of the box. 

Getting a website or web app hosted is a somewhat simple task. But finding hosting alone is not enough for enterprise-level entities.  

For them, we offer out-of-the-box, scalable cloud infrastructure. 

Our Fathym virtual developer has worked through the pain points of setting up a cloud environment within Microsoft Azure. What used to take days or weeks has been simplified and automated, giving those who need an enterprise-level solution immediately the opportunity to do just that.  

There are multiple options for cloud hosting through Fathym and utilizing our Azure expertise.  

The first is cloud provisioning; working within the Fathym cloud. And for enterprises who are already utilizing more than one cloud as, [Flexera’s 2022 State of the Cloud Report explained](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/august/2022-08-19-azure-edges-out-aws), we have them covered, too.  

The second option is having Fathym’s virtual developer set up a **customer’s own cloud within their Azure.** 

And for those who want to start today in our shared cloud, they can always scale up to their own cloud later when needed.
