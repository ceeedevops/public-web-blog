It’s an exciting time at Fathym.  

We kicked off the new year by entering a new phase of business, going from preparation to user-adoption. And the results have been remarkable, so far.  

Since 2022 began, we’ve amassed well over 4,000 new users, and there’s no sign of slowing down either. 

For those new users, it means jumping into our [micro frontends platform](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/february/2022-02-14-fathym-vs-netlify-and-vercel-micro-frontends) and discovering all the possibilities in store. Simultaneously, we’re listening to all the feedback from those beta testers and have rolled out something to fit their biggest complaint: The User Interface.  

## Meet: Fathym’s Social UI for developers 

The issue with our previous UI was it simply wasn’t user-friendly enough, nor was it intuitively understood by our first users. The solution was simple: A social UI which basically everyone should understand immediately thanks to social media’s ubiquity in today’s world.  

“We have familiar gestures and actions which we use every day already; users will notice familiar and similar design on many social platforms,” Fathym’s Kim Loomis explained. “One of the biggest benefits is it reduces the learning curve. The users don't have to learn a new system, they can start using our product right away with their existing mental model.” 

Think of other platforms – like Facebook (Meta), Twitter and Pinterest – and how you can: Find friends, share updates and interesting tidbits of knowledge with them, discover new understanding of the world and more. Thanks to the widely used nature of those platforms, our users will be able to pick up the interface with ease and get down to the business of building a website.  

## Increased speed  

“We want users to focus on what they can do, not learning a new UI dashboard or model,” Loomis continued.  

Fathym’s Social UI was developed specifically so users can instinctively understand how to use it. We expect users will be able to bring about their builds more quickly thanks to that usability. And, because it’s unique, we’re also hoping its simplicity means users are satisfied overall and stick around for longer.  

Another way our Social UI saves developers time is by allowing them to see all the various builds happening on all their projects in one place.  

“Gone are the days a user has to navigate back and forth between repos to see what changes have been made. The user can now see all this and more in one place,” Fathym engineer George Hatch explained.  

## Making developing social 

Developers may like to go it alone and slay code dragons on a solo quest. 

But, what if you didn’t have to?  

Fathym’s Social UI allows developers to share their discoveries, their tips and tricks, and even their code as well as GitHub repositories.  

“The social aspect is awesome,” Loomis said. “If you find something you think is great, you can easily share. Or if you create something cool, you can invite others to it. Plus, it gives an easy means to push or pull others to your projects.” 

For teams, the feed allows everyone to see what each individual developer is working on. That's incredibly valuable in the micro frontends landscape because the whole goal of microservices is to break down the monolith and allow multiple teams to work concurrently on different projects within one, larger goal.
