Developers are in as high demand as new Wordle puzzles.  

According to a survey done by Reveal [Reveal](https://www.revealbi.io/), 53% of companies say recruiting developers is the most challenging hurdle facing them in 2022.  

And who wouldn’t want to be a developer? They’re on the cutting edge of science, which is exciting. Depending on experience and level of education, developers can make more than a living wage, and now there’s a high likelihood of working remotely, too.  

With developers being in such high demand and with growth projected to continue through the end of the decade, maybe companies need to start rethinking how they’re getting things done.  

## Enter: The no-code universe.  

No-code sounds wonderful, although there usually is some coding asked of those building sites. However, it does lower the bar in terms of the amount of education and training one needs to successfully build a website. That means there can be “citizen developers” who cost less who can implement needed changes and additions.  

Those “citizen developers” can then make quick turnaround times for projects, although no-code means using pre-built templates, so there is some customization left to be wanting. 

Still, those savings in terms of training, labor and time are massive. It makes low-code and no-code the next revolution in web design.  

According to an [Information Week piece,](https://www.informationweek.com/software/the-benefits-of-adopting-a-low-code-no-code-development-platform) Ashish Chaturvedi, who is a principal analyst at ISG, believes many software makers will be getting into the low-code/no-code market starting in 2022.  

“The no-code space that was once niche and limiting is spreading its tentacles far and wide,” he states. “The next three years will see it grow to at least three times in market cap.” 

We’ve already seen that growth and trend in the direction of many more companies adopting low-code/no-code.  

As, [Venture Beat explained here,](https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/13/low-code-no-code-increases-efficiency-in-retail-and-beyond/) low-code/no-code use increased from 34% of organizations reporting in 2018/19 to 41% in 2020/21. One positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been an increase in remote work, and the low-code/no-code universe lends itself to remote work, too, because it’s simpler and easier to understand. Meaning there’s less need for help from senior engineers/managers.

So, how can your company start taking advantage of the low-code/no-code universe?  

Fathym, a [modular frontends platform](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/february/2022-02-14-fathym-vs-netlify-and-vercel-micro-frontends), is exactly how.  

Fathym is a modern webhosting service which is positioning itself as a leader in the low-code/no-code sphere. We’re doing so thanks to our platform acting as a [virtual developer](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/february/2022-02-03-freelance-developers-fathym-saves-you-time-as-a-virtual-developer) behind the scenes.  

“It’s picking up the heavy lifting of the hosting and automation,” Fathym engineer Trevor Richardson explained. “Fathym is something someone could build their own business off of.” 

Not only that, but the virtual development aspect allows companies to slim down in terms of human labor needed to accomplish their goals.  

“Obviously you have your QA people, but you don’t need that middleman in terms of setting up these environments for your QA people, they can do it themselves very easily. 

“Just taking out some of the manual, human labor there saves a lot of money and time,” Richardson said. 

For years, we at Fathym have been looking to lower the bar for entry into the coding world. Our no-code platform has done that, allowing us to venture into the space of “flashups” (as opposed to startups).  

[A Flashup](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/february/2022-02-18-flashup-buzz-word-or-brilliant-idea) can be defined as a startup business which is created nearly instantly by giving it a web presence, therefore legitimizing it. By using third-party, open-source applications, we really do offer no-code to the universe of citizen developers, while traditional developers can go the low-code route and customize their applications and pages, too.  

At Fathym, we’re a solution to your development and hosting needs.
