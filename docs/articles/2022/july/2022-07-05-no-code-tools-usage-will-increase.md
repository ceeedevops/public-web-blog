No-code tools have been a revolutionary adjustment in the world of website development because they allow anyone to build a website.  

The technical and non-technical alike. The young, the old, even the restless; everyone and anyone can use no-code tools.  

And why not? Hey, if everyone is using the internet every, single day, that means we all likely have some valuable input on what makes a great website experience.  

On top of that, there are numerous reasons as to why everyday people want a website. Some are working a side hustle, selling handmade goods to help bolster their income. Others look to share their thoughts in a blog or simply have a place to post and share their photos online while retaining ownership. 

Whatever the reason, the rise in usage of no-code tools has been clear over the last two years. 

## The rise in no-code usage 

Simply, no-code tools have been around for about 20 years and they do open the doors to just about anyone being able to design a website. And according to [Zapier’s no-code report](https://zapier.com/blog/no-code-report/), the usage of no-code tools have boomed over the last two years (2020-2022).  

Per that report, 82% of users started on no-code tools over the last two years. 

## Why are people using no-code?  

So, what has led to so many people adopting no-code during the pandemic?  

The apps are usually so easy to use, it gives people the flexibility to build and create something on their own.  

And that has helped people grow professionally, too.  

In Zapier’s study, 70% of those surveyed said they received additional compensation for learning a new tool, and 60% even landed a promotion thanks to the use. 

## No-code means saving time 

As they say, “Time is money.”  

Also incredibly important in their adoption: No-code tools are timesaving.  

A leading 28% of respondents said they learned one because it was the fastest way to achieve something at work.  

In another question about why folks continue to use no-code tools, they answered: To reduce the time tasks take (83%), to automate tasks (76%), and decrease the time it takes to roll out new products or features (73%). 

## Future growth of no-code 

The great irony of this no-code boom is that the users have been mostly technical people over the last two years.  

In fact, 88% of users in the Zapier study reported at least taking some coding courses (38%), being a professional developer (35%) or coding for fun (%15).  

What does that mean? The tools aren’t even being used by their intended audience yet!  

Remember, no-code means no coding/programming experience necessary. And only 12% of users during this latest boom have no experience. Therefore, once more non-technical people start using the wide variety of tools available, there will be “widespread growth” as Zapier explained. 

That’s backed up by another study, too. 

[An analyst predicted a tripling of no-code tool usage by the year 2024.](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/march/2022-03-04-analyst-says-no-code-space-expected-to-grow-three-times) 

So, clearly the world of no-code is here to stay. For some, that’s a huge gain. For others – like developers – a certain amount of eye-rolling accompanies any discussion of no-code tools. 

Of course, those professional developers want to protect their industry. But, they know there are some [downsides to no-code tools, too.](https://www.fathym.com/blog/articles/2022/june/2022-06-28-positives-and-negatives-of-no-code-tools) 

## No-code downsides 

For instance, there’s rigidity in design and developers would know how to fix those design flaws. The same goes with limited functionality of no-code tools, while others are platform dependent which can be a nightmare for pricing and other issues. 

New users of the tools reported their own issues like: Not knowing how to fix problems (36%), unexpected errors affecting others (34%) and lack of budget to buy tool add-ons (24%).  

Of course, going full-force at a no-code builder on your own can lead to not knowing what to do when things go wrong if you’re not a technical person. As far as errors are concerned, a modular frontend approach would help alleviate those potential issues because one section of the website isn’t dependent on the others. And as far as add-ons are concerned, it’s a good idea to avoid no-code tools which are advertised as free but then force you to purchase add-ons which can get expensive. Like WordPress, for instance.
