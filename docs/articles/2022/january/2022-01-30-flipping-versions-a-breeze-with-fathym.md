We’ve all been there before. You make a change to your site and you need to get it live. Or you make a change to your site and you need someone else to review it. And then you need to get it live. Once it’s live you might realize that something’s wrong and you need to roll back to an earlier version.  

Whether you’re a small team or an enterprise, the question remains the same, “How do you easily and quickly switch between versions of your code without disrupting your business?” 

With Fathym, it’s effortless, - thanks to the fact we’re a micro frontend framework.  

Easily host and switch between any build of a GitHub branch or any NPM package version in Fathym. With the click of a button, you can quickly switch versions forwards or backwards. Test version 1.34 and if it doesn’t meet your needs switch back to version 1.33, 1.32, or any other version. 

“The one thing about Fathym hosting that I really like is being able to flip-flop between versions really quick,” Shannon Bruns, a Senior Frontend Developer, explained. “Have it pointed to my GitHub, or my NPM, and being able to go, ‘You know what? I want this version, or I want that version.’ That’s one of the things I really like about this.”  

“If everything’s not in GitHub or NPM, changing between versions is a lot harder,” Jeremy Tomlinson, Director of Engineering, noted.  

Typically, it could take 30 minutes or more to switch versions if you’re using a more manual process and uploading your code to servers. That means lost time, lost productivity doing this tedious work just to switch versions.  

“Now you’re pushing code at that point,” Bruns explained with frustration in his voice. “I want this version in my site, and now I’ve got to upload all this code, however long that takes. And then, inevitably something’s going to break doing that. And you’re sitting there, you’re debugging through that and it’s a nightmare.  

“Whereas with the Fathym you go in, you change the version over and you’re done. There’s no manually deploying code files. So, that’s very helpful,” Bruns finished. 

With Fathym, changing between versions of your code is a breeze. It helps you stay on task and not get pulled off on a tangent and looking back at your day saying, “What did I even do today?” 

“It’s really powerful to be able to switch versions quickly and easily in Fathym,” Tomlinson continued. “As a developer, I love it, but our QA team loves it even more! They can host feature branches and test code normally only available locally on a developer’s computer. It's opened the door wide open to where non-engineers on our team can easily host feature branches, test code, and provide developer feedback.” 

And thanks to Fathym being a micro frontends platform,  the possibilities are endless. Multiple engineers and QA resources  can be working on multiple projects at the same time, switching between versions of their code, all working towards a larger goal.
