## Why you should use no-code tools with hosting flexibility

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/nocodepencil.png)

No-code tools are great: They're easy to use, quick to learn and offer fast turnarounds on projects. 

However, many of the most popular no-code tools also lock in the users to the tools' hosting. 

Instead, look for a no-code builder with hosting flexibility.

Building a website from scratch can seem like a daunting task.  

Especially if you’re not a web developer.  

One option is to use a content management system, or CMS, a static site generator (or JavaScript) and then utilize a hosting service to stand up your site. In this case, let's use Netlify CMS and Fathym together.

No-code, no problem?

## Addressing micro frontend criticisms | Environmental Differences

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/devshelpingdevs2.png) 

In 2019, when Martin Fowler wrote about micro frontends, Cam Jackson argued three different downsides to the frontend architecture style. 

Payload size -- we already addressed -- environmental differences and operational governance. We're working our way through all three, with this blog specifically focused on environmental differences. 

Read how we tackle the issue at Fathym.

## Go fully modular with micro frontends

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/newmfe2.png) 

One of the misconceptions about micro frontends is the way the architecture actually works. At least, with us.  

In the past – and even still today – some would break a single page, say the homepage, down to multiple components. That’s not exactly how we do micro frontends.  

Instead, in the fully modular approach, each page is created by a separate team or developer.

## Why a React developer used Svelte on his Arcade

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/arcadeinterior.png)

If you build websites, you likely have a favorite JavaScript framework you use.  

And it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Once you learn a specific framework (or library, in the case of React), you know the ins and outs of it. You learn how to get things done in an efficient manner. You pick up the tips and tricks for fixing issues.  

So, why'd a React developer use Svelte for his arcade?
