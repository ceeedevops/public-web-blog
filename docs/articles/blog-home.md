One of the misconceptions about micro frontends is the way the architecture actually works. At least, with us.

## Why a React developer used Svelte on his Arcade

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/arcadeinterior.png)

If you build websites, you likely have a favorite JavaScript framework you use.  

And it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Once you learn a specific framework (or library, in the case of React), you know the ins and outs of it. You learn how to get things done in an efficient manner. You pick up the tips and tricks for fixing issues.  

So, why'd a React developer use Svelte for his arcade?
