## Attaining inclusivity by using low-code and no-code apps

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/nocodeboard.jpeg)

Low-code and no-code builders have been on the rise lately, and what makes them wonderful is the way they lower the bar for users in terms of expertise needed. Now, with a low -- and especially a no-code builder -- a "citizen developer" on your team can possibly do a lot more than before. 

As our Fathym platform is open to folks using no-code and low-code softwares, now almost anyone can stand up their own website, for free, and quickly. That means our goal of inclusivity is being realized.

## How to modularize your monolith frontend, transition at your pace

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/MFERPlasmicGatsbyDocuReact.png)

Being frontend agnostic means we don't care if developers use the tried and true monolith or the newer-aged modular approach to building a website.

Here, we explain how a person can dip their toes into the micro frontends universe and break one piece of their monolith apart. 

As we explain how it's done here, we will also have a Dicord Live tomorrow (Wed, June 1 at 2 p.m. MDT) to walk folks through how it's done.

## How to garden better with an environmental sensor
![](https://www.fathym.com/img/gardeniot2.jpeg)

There are a ton of different sensors available, but for this case we’re going to use SparkFun’s environmental sensor. 

SparkFun is a Boulder-based company just like us at Fathym, and they make great products.  

This [environmental sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16466) combines four different sensors into one. At a mere $22.50, it’s relatively inexpensive way to get a ton of quality information with the single sensor.

## How to build a headless WordPress with React

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/reactlogo.png)

WordPress is widely regarded as one of the most popular content management systems in the world.  

But, there are some drawbacks. Lack of strong security, need for expensive plugins and slow websites. 

A headless WordPress is the solution to all those issues, especially when it's built with React.

## Why a React developer used Svelte on his Arcade

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/arcadeinterior.png)

If you build websites, you likely have a favorite JavaScript framework you use.  

And it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Once you learn a specific framework (or library, in the case of React), you know the ins and outs of it. You learn how to get things done in an efficient manner. You pick up the tips and tricks for fixing issues.  

So, why'd a React developer use Svelte for his arcade?

## Using our arcade to help explain micro frontends

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/arcadescreenshot.png)

Back in the day, there were a few things that were great about childhood.  

Saturday morning cartoons. Breakfast for dinner. Staying up past your bedtime.  

And going to the arcade with a pocket full of quarters. Those neon lights blinking with the sound of tickets printing out of the machines. Trying to win prizes you’d never play with again and forcing your little brother to run up the skeeball machine to cheat the system. 

Our arcade is the example of how we use micro frontends at Fathym.

At the start of 2022 we released Fathym in beta. Since then it’s been incredible to see the reaction, with over 15,000 signups and 5,000 sites and web applications deployed on Fathym. Through this period, we have received valuable feedback from users and were able to put that to work by resolving bugs while improving speed and performance. 

Today, we are delighted to announce that Fathym has concluded the beta period and is now generally available. We are particularly excited to unveil extended functionality and features so you can do even more and scale development through our paid plans.
