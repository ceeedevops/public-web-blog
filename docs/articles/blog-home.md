WordPress is one of the most popular website content management systems in the world today. However, it does have some downsides.

If you build websites, you likely have a favorite JavaScript framework you use.  

And it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Once you learn a specific framework (or library, in the case of React), you know the ins and outs of it. You learn how to get things done in an efficient manner. You pick up the tips and tricks for fixing issues.  

So, why'd a React developer use Svelte for his arcade?
