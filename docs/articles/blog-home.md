Have you seen the new Abercrombie and Fitch documentary on Netflix? While *trying* to watch it this week, the concepts of brand management and flexibility were clear. 

As with the former clothing giant, brands today must be flexible and able to adapt their messaging in a hurry, or fall victim to closing down. 

By deploying a website with Svelte, you can not only quickly launch a site, but change it whenever and however necessary.

Within WordPress, creators are limited. They’re boxed into whatever plugins the CMS has already built.  

Instead, developers have the ability to create new and unique design layouts. You can decide how best to display your content, and how your end-users interact with that content.  

Let’s say you’re a fashion company. You can have a gallery of the latest T-shirts you’ve designed. But, when the user clicks the picture, they’re taken to a new page, which is a video of the model walking through the streets in that shirt.
