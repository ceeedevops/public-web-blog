## A simple Micro Frontends explainer

![No code launch](/img/microfrontendsvisfathym.png)

The world of tech is all about advancing, improving, and evolving. Sometimes quickly, and sometimes it takes a while for changes to catch on.  

When it comes to micro frontends, it’s been a longer process to acceptance, but we’ve fully embraced all the positive possibilities they bring.  

Micro frontends as a concept started showing up on the radar of developers and others in the space back in 2016. And then it gained even more prominence with [Martin Fowler’s piece](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html) on the frontend architecture in 2019.

Full disclosure: I’m not a coder. Or a developer. I don’t even know how to spell HTML. Wait… 

The truth is, what I am is an artist. I paint, create furniture out of wood, I create dishes in the kitchen, and I write.  

Those two things – being a developer and an artist – don’t necessarily have to be on opposite ends of the spectrum, though. Artists can, and do, work within limits and rules. Although, they’re probably not as extensive as the rules of the road when writing code, think of the many confusing rules of the English language.
