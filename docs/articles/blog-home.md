## How to use Gruerilla IoT for end-to-end encrypted messaging

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/encryptionkey.png)

In our current world, most everyone can communicate easily and quickly thanks to the smartphones in our pockets. 

But, what happens when someone wants to read your texts, emails or direct messages? Sure, there are encrypted messaging apps, but what if someone went a level higher and hacked into the OS and intalled a keylogger?

That pushed us to dream up an end-to-end ecrypted messaging device.

## Why you should use no-code tools with hosting flexibility

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/nocodepencil.png)

No-code tools are great: They're easy to use, quick to learn and offer fast turnarounds on projects. 

However, many of the most popular no-code tools also lock in the users to the tools' hosting. 

Instead, look for a no-code builder with hosting flexibility.

## Go fully modular with micro frontends

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/newmfe2.png) 

One of the misconceptions about micro frontends is the way the architecture actually works. At least, with us.  

In the past – and even still today – some would break a single page, say the homepage, down to multiple components. That’s not exactly how we do micro frontends.  

Instead, in the fully modular approach, each page is created by a separate team or developer.

## Why a React developer used Svelte on his Arcade

![](https://www.fathym.com/img/arcadeinterior.png)

If you build websites, you likely have a favorite JavaScript framework you use.  

And it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Once you learn a specific framework (or library, in the case of React), you know the ins and outs of it. You learn how to get things done in an efficient manner. You pick up the tips and tricks for fixing issues.  

So, why'd a React developer use Svelte for his arcade?
