“If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.”

Albert Einstein

### Searching indeed.com for Software Engineer jobs in the United States brings back a whopping 247,674 job results.

Labor shortages are a reality, especially in the tech space. There was already a shortage pre-pandemic and it’s become worse over the last 18 months. Now with countries and economies reopening as they manage the pandemic, the issue is getting worse again. People are voluntarily quitting their jobs or not taking jobs. 

The reasons are many: 
- retiring early
- want better pay
- want a flexible working arrangement
- don’t want to go to an office as they’re nervous about Covid
- want to see if they can finally make that leap and start their own business. 

That’s just a few of the reasons, but whatever the reasons are, the staff that companies do have they are desperately trying to hang on to them.

To make matters worse, the companies must not drive away their existing staff as the staff take on additional responsibilities due the gaps in their workforce. To keep workflows and processes moving forward successfully, staff may have to don different hats, work excessive hours and jump in to do what needs to be done. It can be exhausting and frustrating for the staff. It can be daunting for the company and its ability to maintain viability. Companies in the mode of launching new products to boost value and business outcomes may fail, or worse, not be able to launch at all if there is a lack of appropriate workers to implement and support the technology.

### Traditional hiring practices need to be thrown out. 

The age-old looking for workers with technical skills of this, tools of that and languages of x, y and z need to be re-examined. Requiring someone to have specific credentials, a particular level of education and several years of experience need to be scrutinized and revamped. 

Trade that in for looking for solid problem-solvers with good communication and adaptability skills regardless of what their background might be. Those are the soft skills that are hard to teach. It’s easier to teach an innate problem-solver how to use a tool. The pandemic has fundamentally changed culture and economies and altered how employees want to work. Hiring perspectives and practices must change, too.

### That’s where Fathym comes in.

Fathym helps address the imbalance in software development. Over the years, there has been a steady progression of removing the complex tasks that only a handful of senior engineers can tackle. Fathym plays a crucial role in this progression. Fathym helps diverse groups of people rapidly build and deploy cloud-native applications. 

Tools like [Fathym](https://www.fathym.com/) offer a point-and-click interface and menu configuration that allows easy build, deploy, serving up and management of web projects. No/low coding required. Companies that have workforce gaps can employ the Fathym tools and do two impactful things straight away: 1) augment the skills of their current workforce and, 2) make the less typical technology hire.

Hiring and managing a team of “Engineers” is not necessary. Hire the Problem Solvers and equip them with a great set of tools.
