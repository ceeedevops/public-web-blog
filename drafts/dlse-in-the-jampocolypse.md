Your back against the wall, peering over cover, phaser set to stun. Unknown species barreling down at you and your team from the end of the corridor... I think every developers been there before, if not, be forewarned that your day will come. When it does its best to be prepared, with an approach that allows you to turn unknown species back into bosses, and deliver work that scales for the business.


I've stared down that double-barrelled shotgun of a bull snout, fuming smoke from shots already fired. With a solution that, in the end, only I (or a colleague) could manage on their own. Everyone wants to help, but with so many APIs connected, through so much Javascript, and markup, how could everyone jump in at once to be hero-as-a-team. No, I'm not talking about JAMStack (at least not yet), but I am talking about a time before our myriad of API stacks, when all the API connections and calls were managed through javascript. While powerful, fast forward from that time to a world of microservices and the dawn of micro frontends, I'm not so sure its time to throw layered trifles with the bath water just yet.

## A post JAMStack World

I'm not saying that JAMStack isn't without its value, and I think at the right time it can be a perfect pattern to pull out of your developer toolbelt.  However, it isn't all its cracked up to be.  Its sounds glorious and simple, but not everything you do can be done with an existing SaaS or open source API/offering.  So this inevitbly leaves the developer in charge of cobbling together their own custom APIs to access custom data and leverage custom logic.  All in order to implement a BFF (Backend for Frontend API) that still has you back in the same place we started.  Now though, we have APIs and logic muddling up our javascript and markup, which should be leveraged to do what it does best and render a UI to create a user experience.

Have we Now lost our identity though?  How do we scale our API?  How do we address small details in our memory handling, how do we leverage tech in the cloud and at the edge?  If we succeed, and we want to sell our company, is there as much value in a JAMStack implementation as there is with a fully managed, custom enterprise cloud?
